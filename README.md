# winPhone8_side-channel-attack
In this project we have two Windows Phone 8 apps which perform a collusion attack via a covert channel (MediaLibrary).

This example was created for the course "Mobile Security Seminar" at TU Darmstadt in 2013 by Marc-André Bär. 

It is for demonstration and educational use only. It may contain errors or bugs.

The Wiki page shows more information about the applications.
